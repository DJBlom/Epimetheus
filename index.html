                <p>
                    Rate Monotonic RM is a pre-emptive, fixed priority, multi-programming, run-to-completion scheduling algorithm 
                    used in real-time systems. Furthermore, its domain is critical systems, where if a service exceeds its execution 
                    time limit, it could mean loss of life or capital. Nevertheless, systems that are less constrained can also benefit 
                    from it. According to Lui & Layland, there are a few assumptions that we are required to make to obtain any analytical 
                    results about program behavior in hard-real-time situations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these assumptions provide us with guidance but are not always necessary. Firstly, the requests for all tasks 
                    for which hard deadlines exist are periodic, with constant intervals between requests. Secondly, every service in the 
                    set of services must complete before its next request period. Thirdly, each task is independent and does not rely on 
                    another to finish or initiate. Fourthly, the run-time for each service is constant for that task and does not vary with 
                    time, for example, the time a processor needs to execute the task without interruption. Finally, any nonperiodic services 
                    in the system are special. They are usually initialization or failure-recovery routines. They displace periodic services 
                    while they are running. They do not have hard critical deadlines. Consequently, now that we know what assumptions to make, 
                    how can we measure and visualize this arcane art? Thankfully, Lui & Layland derived a mathematical model called the Rate 
                    Monotonic Least Upper Bound.
                </p>
                <div class="information-headings">Rate Monotonic Least Upper Bound</div>
                <p>
                    The mathematical model you see above is the famous Rate Monotonic Least Upper Bound RM-LUB, derived by Lui & Layland in 1973. 
                    Applying this model, we determine if a system's schedule for a set of 'm' periodic tasks with unique execution times will 
                    always meet its deadlines. However, this is only true if the total CPU utilization 'U' is below the LUB. Therefore, a system 
                    is feasible if all its task computation time does not exceed the LUB. An example of a passing system using the RM-LUB is if 
                    30% of the system running time is idle. For instance, if the RM-LUB is 70%, then the remaining 30% would be dedicated to services 
                    that do not require them to meet their deadlines. However, this percentage is debatable since a system can run smoothly with less 
                    than 30% slack time, but that is up to the architect to decide. In reality, reaching 30% idle time is not easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the model above, let's assume we have a system with three services. Service 1 has an execution time of one and a release 
                    period of two. $$\frac {1}{2}$$ Service 2 has an execution time of one every tenth release period of twenty. $$\frac {1}{20}$$ 
                    Service 3 has one execution time for a release period of thirty. $$\frac {1}{30}$$ Where the execution times 'C' and release 
                    periods or deadlines 'T' are summed up and divided, providing us with the total CPU utilization. Finally, we verify that 'U' 
                    is less than or equal to the LUB. For instance, $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{30} \leq 3(2^\frac {1}{3} - 1)$$ completing 
                    the math we end up with 'U' = 58.33%, LUB = 77.98%, and slack time of 19.65%. Now that we know how the RM-LUB works and how to use 
                    it to verify the feasibility of our system, what does this website offer?

                <div class="information-headings">What This Website Offers</div>
                <p>
                    This website provides a quick way to verify your system's feasibility using the RM-LUB with minimum effort. The first step 
                    would be to head over to the <a class="paragraph-page-links" href="./test.html">Test</a> page and decide what the execution 
                    time for each deadline will be. After that, provide the input, after which the underlying algorithm will spit out your system's 
                    total utilization 'U', the RM-LUB percentage, the slack time, the feasibility status, and the visual representation of your schedule.
